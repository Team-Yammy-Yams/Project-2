        <h1> Frayed Knot Arts </h1> 
             <p><strong> 
                  Welcome to all, and thank you for stopping by to look over
                  my wares.  I have been doing fancy-work on-and-off for
                  over fifty-five years, ever since I was initially taught it by an
                  old sailor who lived quite close to me.  I used the know-
                  ledge through my Navy days and have now taken it up again
                  as a full-time business.  


                  I make belts, lanyards, wheel-coverings, tiller-wraps, hand-rail wraps, bellropes
                  of varying complexity, instrument straps, camera straps,  luggage slings....
                  if you can do it with a piece of  line, I've probably either made it or seen it.  I
                  can do MacNamara's lace and mast skirts, but  they tend to get verrrry
                  expensive due to the great amount of time involved.
